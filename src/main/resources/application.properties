#Homework: how to have 2 databases in the same application (we cannot use 2 spring.datasource.url). And whether this is suggested or not
#hibernate's dialect - resolved (lines below with the database configuration)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/jbdl33_jpa?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=7u6iwTmjisGoAi

#how to behave on application run - we have to tell hibernate what we will be doing with the schema (DB)
#use update so it will create the data if needed and will not delete any existing data (no like create or create-drop)
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

#see if SQL queries are being executed
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
